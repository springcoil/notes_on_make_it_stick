# Notes on Make it Stick

These are personal notes summarizing what I learned out of MakeItStick

How to learn effectively 
* Quiz yourself 
* Create questions to test yourself on your knowledge

* Do questions and try these before looking at examples. Students often pick methods that give the illusion of mastery

* "Testing is not only a powerful learning strategy, it is a potent reality
check on the accuracy of your own judgement of what you know how to do."

* Testing is not a dipstick but a learning tool. 

## Some good strategies##
* low-stake quizzing and self-testing
* spacing out practice
* interleaving the practice of different but related topics or skills
* trying to solve a problem before being given the answer
* distilling the underlying principles or rules that differentiate different kinds of problems (Technical Explanation Questions is what Cal Newport a Professor calls this) 
* Practice at retrieving new knowledge or skill from memory is a potent tool for learning and durable retention.
* Effortful retrieval is best!!!!

* Testing can be flashcards 
* Students who take practice tests have a better grasp of their progress than 
those who simply read the material 

* Similarly, such testing enables an instructor to spot gaps and misconceptions and adopt instruction to correct them. 

* **Spacing** is very import - like randomly shuffled flash cards (split up your study and review)

* One of the biggest challenges we have with learning is the 'illusion of familiarity' - this misleads you about your learning - you have to be self-disciplined and force yourself to practice skills.

* The book also goes into the various psychological terminology  - like encoding, consolidation and retrieval. 

## Robust learning ##
* Recode and consolidate the short term memory into long term memory and anchor it.
* Associate the material with a diverse set of cues so you can recall the knowledge

# We all make mistakes #
* Errorless learning is a myth
* Need effortful retrieval - so be rusty when you practice
* Interleaving and variation such as when you shuffle material in the lecture

* Flash cards
* Explaining key concepts in your own words
* Instruct your peers 
* Space your testing, vary your practice, keep the long view

* Re-organize course information into a study guide of his design
* Copy bolded terms into a reading note book 
* Generation of ideas and concepts on a blank page - for example 'describe Newtons laws' 

* Reflection - summarizing what you learned this week is a good idea. 
* Reviewing your mistakes and seeing what you can learn from them - this is an important gift that testing gives you.
